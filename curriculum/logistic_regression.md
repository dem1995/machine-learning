### External Resources
* [Logistic Regression](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/logistic.html) - Christoph Molnar has put together the best walkthrough of logistic regression I could find (I searched for a while).
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression#Logistic_model] Offers a very concise, but not particularly intuitive look at logistic regression, as well.
