# Probability
## Part 1: Fundamentals
### Samples and Events
Probability deals with _outcomes_, the results that can and do happen in our world. We'll give some formal definitions to begin with, then flesh them out with a real-world example.

#### Definitions
Formally, we refer to tiny discrete outcomes as **samples**.  We refer to collections of those samples as **events**. Samples are drawn from the set of all samples, the **sample space ‚Ñ¶**; events are drawn from the set of all events, the **event space ‚Ñ∞**, and, as events are just collections of outcomes, ‚Ñ∞ = set of all possible sets of samples, ùí´(‚Ñ¶), the power set of ‚Ñ¶.

#### Example
As an example, suppose you're rolling a six-sided dice. The samples space here is ‚Ñ¶=`{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`. The event space, meanwhile, is all the ways you could get some number of these samples - ‚Ñ∞=`{ {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, ..., {1, 2}, {1, 3}, ..., {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}}`. **By focusing on the event space, this not only lets us talk about "hey, look, I rolled a 3" - the event {3} - but also more complicated situations, like "hey, look, I rolled an even number" - the event {2, 4, 6}.**

The event space ‚Ñ∞ must satisfy that

1. If an event A is in ‚Ñ∞, then A·∂ú is in ‚Ñ∞. In other words, &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/A%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathcal%20E%20%5CRightarrow%20A%5Ec%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathcal%20E" alt="A \in \mathcal E \Rightarrow A^c \in \mathcal E" />
2. If a collection of events A‚ÇÅ, A‚ÇÇ... is in ‚Ñ∞, then the set of all their constituent samples ‚à™(A‚ÇÅ, A‚ÇÇ...) is an event in ‚Ñ∞. In other words, &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/A_1%2C%20A_2%2C%20...%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathcal%20E%20%5CRightarrow%20%5Cleft(%5Cbigcup%20A_1%2C%20A_2%20...%5Cright)%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathcal%20E" alt="A_1, A_2, ... \in \mathcal E \Rightarrow \left(\bigcup A_1, A_2 ...\right) \in \mathcal E" />
3. There is at least one event. In other words, <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%7C%5Cmathcal%20E%7C%3E0" alt="|\mathcal E|&gt;0" />
