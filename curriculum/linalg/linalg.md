- [Brian Sanderson (3Blue1Brown)'s _Essence of Linear Algebra_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown) provides a _fantastic_ introduction to linear algebra (and the 15-part series, in totality, covers what a first-year course in the subject would). For this course, remembering the videos' contents is possibly overkill, but you may find that having at least an awareness of their material proves useful. Episodes 1-9 provide a fairly comprehensive overview of linear transformations and dot products.

- [Foundations of Machine Learning: Linear Algebra](https://the-learning-machine.com/article/machine-learning/linear-algebra) is your referential pal whenever you need to know more about a linear algebraic terms for this course (as well as for material beyond the scope of this course). It lays out terms and descriptions of them in friendly, easily-digestible chunks, and offers interactive visualizations of a number of them for your convenience.
