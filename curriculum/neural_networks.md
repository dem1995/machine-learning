### External Resources
Overview:
* [Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown)'s "But What is a Neural Network?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown) beatiful animations/visuals for picturing what a basic Neural Network does/looks like. Also gives some intuition of the importance of explainanability/building up NNs from explainable features

Gradients and Gradient Descent
* ["Gradient Descent"](https://builtin.com/data-science/gradient-descent) - Good introductory page for learning rate, and a brief look at batch/stochastic GD
* [Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown)'s "Gradient Descent, how Neural Networks Learn"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown)
* [Differentiation with respect to a vector](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/0471705195.app3)
