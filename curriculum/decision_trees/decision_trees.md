### External Resources
- (Before/During) [Prateek Karkare's _Decision Trees — An Intuitive Introduction_](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/02/decision-trees-introduction.html) offers a very good first glance at decision trees. I highly recommend checking it out, especially the first page. You can look at it before reading this page without issue.
- (During/After) [Kilian Weinberger's SVM Lecture Notes](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2018fa/lectures/lecturenote09.html) Interactive demo for plotting points/forming a decision tree for classified points in a 2D plane. Also useful for understanding decision trees in the sense of a spatial perspective upon the data being classified, and has pseudocode for training a decision tree.
