### External Resources
* ["Linear Classification"](https://mlweb.loria.fr/book/en/linearclassification.html) by Fabien Lauer of the Universit√© de Lorraine gives a very straightforward introduction to the idea behind linear classification, leading up to an equation example and a formal definition of linear separability. I highly recommend checking this out first; it's also available in French.
