### External Resources
####Overview
Two very brief reads are given below - a linked Quora post, as well as the introduction section and the "Classification" section of the Wikipedia page.
Read the Quora post, then skim the Wikipedia page. This should be enough to get the basics of regularization
* [What is regularization in Machine learning?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-regularization-in-machine-learning)
* [Regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)) - just the top section and the "Classification" section. Don't dwell too much on the specifics other than that the regularization is being added to a loss function
A further less-quick (but fairly surface-level) read with a nice visual of how regularization could affect a learned model is 
* https://dzone.com/articles/what-when-amp-why-of-regularization-in-machine-learning
#### Specifics
* [Types of regularization in machine learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/types-of-regularization-in-machine-learning-eb5ce5f9bf50)
* [The difference between L1 and L2 regularization](https://explained.ai/regularization/L1vsL2.html) - details some of the specifics behind $$\ell_1$$ and $$\ell_2$$ regularization
