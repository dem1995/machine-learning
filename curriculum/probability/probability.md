# Probability
## Part 1: Fundamentals
### Samples and Events
Probability deals with _outcomes_, the results that can and do happen in our world. We'll give some formal definitions to begin with, then flesh them out with a real-world example.

#### Definitions
Formally, we refer to tiny discrete outcomes as **samples**, and outcomes composed of those samples as **events**. Samples are drawn from the set of all samples, the **sample space Ω**; events are drawn from the set of all events, the **event space ℰ**, and since events are sets of outcomes, ℰ = the power set of Ω, P(Ω). The event space ℰ must satisfy that

1. If an event A is in ℰ, then Aᶜ is in ℰ. In other words, &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/A%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathcal%20E%20%5CRightarrow%20A%5Ec%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathcal%20E" alt="A \in \mathcal E \Rightarrow A^c \in \mathcal E" />
2. If a collection of events A₁, A₂... is in ℰ, then the set of all their constituent samples ∪(A₁, A₂...) is an event in ℰ. In other words, &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/A_1%2C%20A_2%2C%20...%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathcal%20E%20%5CRightarrow%20%5Cleft(%5Cbigcup%20A_1%2C%20A_2%20...%5Cright)%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathcal%20E" alt="A_1, A_2, ... \in \mathcal E \Rightarrow \left(\bigcup A_1, A_2 ...\right) \in \mathcal E" />
3. There is at least one event. In other words, <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%7C%5Cmathcal%20E%7C%3E0" alt="|\mathcal E|&gt;0" />
